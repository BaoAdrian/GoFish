# GoFish
Final Project for ECE175


<h1> Latest Adjustments </h1>

<ul>
  <li> 11/21/2018 - Implement structure to read in a file of pre-formatted input used to initialize the standard 52-deck and populate Linked List with values read from the file </li>
  
  <li> 11/24/2018 - Create Reference Programs folder to include various different programs to reference certain methods and function used to implement the final project structure.
  
- First program uploaded includes doubly-linked list creation by using double pointers.
- Second program uploaded includes how to swap values from two nodes with given indices. We can use this method to shuffle the deck of cards
</li>

<li> 11/24/2018 - Implement structure of Double-Linked List. Uses double pointers to populate the LinkedList by parsing a given file and adding each Card structure to the LinkedList. </li>
<li> 11/24/2018 - Implement shuffling structure of the main deck of cards upon initial start of the game. Currently set to 100 swaps to shuffle the deck. Will swap the value and suit of the card to avoid restructuring the entire linked list. </li>
</ul>
