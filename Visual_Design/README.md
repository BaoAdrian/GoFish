This is just a simple visual of the optionso of implementation of the game mechanics using either a Singly-Linked Lists or Doubly-Linked Lists.

main.c contains the file we can use as reference to print the deck of cards using the unicode characters for hearts, spades, clubs, and diamonds. Examples shown just include Aces but we can set a loop to display as needed.


TASK FOR LIAM: In the main.c file above, there is the visual format of each suit of a card in the deck. You can use that to print the cards. What I would like or you to try and figure out is the title and become familiar with printing the cards! It is what we will use to display our rotation of turns throughout the game! Above is an example (we don't have to necessarily use it) of a title we can do that will use the display of cards. (P.S. Printing these actual card designs is extra credit!)
